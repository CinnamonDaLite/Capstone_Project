# Capstone_Project

### Motivation
 - If the vaccine is safe, 
 - why are there people not taking it?
   - could it be because they are not reciving the treatment they need to bear through their symptoms for this vaccine?
   - Or could it be that the vaccine is not as safe as we thought?
 - How can we fix it so everyone can safely take the vaccine?

### Goals

#### What kind of medication would help our patiants after taking the vaccine?
Finding top ten most common symptoms for the COVID-19 vaccine
4 Bar graphs:
 - Overall
 - Per Gender
 - Per age group
 - Per Manufacturer

#### How safe is the vaccine? What will happen if it does go wrong?
4 Bar graphs (stack, percents):
 - Overall
 - Per Gender
 - Per age group (work in progress 
 - Per Manufacturer
 - Discalmer: May not finish the other three graphs due to time contrants, but it seems that the first is sufficent upon answering this question

### Data sources

### Updates:
 - 2/7/22: Final commit. will be posted on blog shortly
 - 2/3/22: Possibly final update unless new update states otherwise
 - 1/31/22: Second update of the new year with major changes:
     - more tabs to complete the goals above
         - created bar graphs by symptom, age, gender and manufacturer
         - deleted overall chance because it is irrelavant to the goals of the project
     - took top 20 instead of top 10
     - reworked the box and graph scale
     - added Splash page and about page (In progress)
 - 1/17/22: First update in the new year, and a big update too:
   - Shiny app redesign (now with one graph and three boxes that are a work in progress)
   - Found a dataset that came with VAERS, but didn't bother using until now (VAERSSYMPTOMS dataset)
      - Makes the whole symptom search a lot easier
 - 12/23/21_V2: Added per manufacturer last second
 - 12/23/21_V1: Conclusions found. Just about ready to present
 - 12/22/21: Fixed box problem. Changed narrative to find a conclusion.
   - Disclamer: I have no intent to show any political bias. I'm answering these questions with data so that all of us may see it for ourselves.
   - Note: I am doing everything I can to avoid anything that could be misleading, or would lead to any sort of bias.
 - 12/20/21: putting age groups and gender on separate graphs (cleanup)
 - 12/18/21: project submitted, working on the presentation
