# Capstone_Project

### Motivation
 - If the vaccine is safe, 
 - why are there people not taking it?
   - could it be because they are not reciving the treatment they need to bear through their symptoms for this vaccine?
   - Or could it be that the vaccine is not as safe as we thought?
 - How can we fix it so everyone can safely take the vaccine?

### Goals

#### What kind of medication would help our patiants after taking the vaccine?
Finding top ten most common symptoms for the COVID-19 vaccine
4 Bar graphs:
 - Overall
 - Per Gender
 - Per age group
 - Per Manufacturer

#### How safe is the vaccine?
4 Bar graphs (stack, percents):
 - Overall
 - <strike>Per Gender
 - Per age group
 - Per Manufacturer</strike> 
 - Discalmer: May not finish the other three graphs due to time contrants, but it seems that the first is sufficent upon answering this question
